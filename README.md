### Hi there, I'm James 👋

- 💼 I’m currently as a Software Engineer at [Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb) in Manchester, UK. Some things I've been working on:
  -  Internal experimentation programme, using Functional Programming - written with Scala, ZIO, Doobie, Caliban, etc.
  -  GitHub Actions for CI/CD, previews, extra checks etc.
  -  Static sites (Hugo, Docusaurus) for runbooks & documentation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Elixir/Phoenix (and a bit of Tailwind CSS!)
- ⚡ Fun fact: 我会说一点中文（五年以前开始。。！）
