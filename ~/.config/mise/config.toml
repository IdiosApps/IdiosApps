  # works with "brew install docker"
# podman - OSS
  # install podman CLI (via browser -> app install, or brew install podman)
  # or, install podman desktop (via browser -> app install)
  # alias docker to podman
    # "brew install docker-compose" works too; "executing external compose provider docker-compose". Even "podman compose" hands over to docker compose.
  # so far minor issues like needing docker-credential-helper, https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2131#issuecomment-343712703
  # cleanup notes https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11319
# portainer - not drop-in replacement for docker; requires docker (https://docs.portainer.io/start/install-ce/server/docker/linux)
# orbstack - $8/m enterprise, free personal, some OSS components
# docker desktop - $5/m; "brew install docker" isn't enough due to missing daemon. heavy too
# dockstation - not OSS, not updated for 3 years
